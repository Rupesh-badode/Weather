In this project, you have to visit the link.
After this, this application will open. Then first of all we will search for a city whose weather status we want to know.
Now we can see the temperature, pressure, humidity and 5 forecasts of any city in it. Along with this, we will be able to add any city to the favourite list and see the search history.
In this project, I have used technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and React.
